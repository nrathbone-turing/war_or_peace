      # but couldn't quite figure it out here, but I imagine it would probably function similarly, where I just specify the starting
      # and ending index position based on the maximum array length which would be 13 so maybe like `all_values = (0..13).to_a`

# notes for additional improvements and future refactors to increase complexity
  # not sure if i need to use an attr_writer or attr_accessor?

# as a part of the "GO" input, could have some conditional follow-up inputs to vary the nuumber of players and decks
# if i do this i need to add the instance variables to the initialize method with default return values, maybe like this
   #@deck_size = 52
   #@player_count = 2
